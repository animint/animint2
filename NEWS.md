# Changes in version 2023.12.14 (PR#112)

- move servr from Suggests to Imports, for more user-friendly installation / getting started for newbies (no need for separate install command for servr).
- bugfix in compiler height_proportion computation, which occured in ggplots with space=free and both vertical/horizontal panels. Before the vertical panels were always the same size, now they can be different sizes.

# Changes in version 2023.11.21

- setDTthreads(1) in CRAN testthat.R (created from build.sh).
- use servr by default when open.browser=TRUE.

# Changes in version 2023.11.16 (PR#88)

- Before creating a new out.dir, do not remove old out.dir, and
  instead stop with an error, if out.dir already exists, but
  animint.js does not.

# Changes in 2023.11.15 (PR#101)

- New function `animint2pages(viz,"new_github_repo")` for
  publishing/sharing animints, replacement for animint2gist, which
  stopped working recently.
- New option `animint(source="http://path.to/source.R")` which should
  be the URL of data viz source code, used to display a link below the
  rendered viz.
- New function `update_gallery("path/to/gallery_repo")` for updating
  galleries such as https://animint.github.io/gallery/
- Bugfix: geom_text renders color as svg fill style (was rendering as
  stroke style, a regression introduced by the initial implementation
  of `fill_off`).
- re-organization of animint.js in order to reduce duplication /
  emphasize similarities and differences between geoms.
- geom rect and tile now default to color="black" instead of
  transparent, for consistency with other geoms (and for the case of
  using clickSelects, which defaults to black color for selected, and
  transparent for not). To get the old behavior, specify
  color="transparent" (for non-clickSelects).

# Changes in 2019.7.12

- Added three authors which are mentioned in Rd/R files.

# Changes in 2019.7.3

# Changes in 2019.6.4

- bugfix for facet_grid(scales/space="free")
- bugfix for update_axes with geom_abline
- bugfix for graph height computation, which only showed up when there were lots of rows in the facet spec.

# Changes in 2018.12.14

- animint fun, export print method.
- infinite values converted to range min/max before saving tsv files.

# Changes in 2018.10.4

- DEP: no longer depend on any branch of ggplot2.
- train_layout from ggplot2 - R/panel.r function is now g_train_layout. train_layout from animint2 - R/z_facet.R function is the same. Both are internal functions.

# Changes in 2017.08.24

- DSL: clickSelects/showSelected are now specified as parameters rather than aesthetics.
