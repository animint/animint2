## About

Animint2 is an R package for generating and sharing interactive data visualizations, sometimes referred to as animints. It is a fork of, and uses similar syntax to, [ggplot2](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/). Animint2 is especially useful for large datasets, but smaller datasets can be made interactive, too. It is also capable of generating static data visualizations.

The user types in the selection menu and clicks on the legend, which causes changes in the visualization. GIF."></a> <!-- If you're familiar with Markdown, you may be wondering why I've elected to use HTML here instead of using the conventional ![alt text](source). It's cuz R's pkgdown package renders the alt text as both alt text and a fig caption. That's redundant. Using <img> ensures that it comes out the way we want. -->

Play around with [this interactive data visualization of data from the World Bank](https://rcdata.nau.edu/genomic-ml/WorldBank-facets/). For more examples, see these galleries, which have screenshots along with links to the interactive data viz, and source code:
* [NAU rcdata animint gallery](https://rcdata.nau.edu/genomic-ml/animint-gallery/) has 50+ big data viz examples dating back to animint's inception in 2014.
* [GitHub Pages animint gallery](https://animint.github.io/gallery) is a newer collection of animints that have been published using the `animint2pages` function.

To learn how to generate your own interactive data visualizations, go to the official [Animint2 Manual](https://rcdata.nau.edu/genomic-ml/animint2-manual/Ch00-preface.html). If you encounter problems, please see the [animint2 wiki](https://github.com/animint/animint2/wiki) or [report them](https://github.com/animint/animint2/issues).

## Installation

``` r
# Install the official package from CRAN.
# This is the option most people should choose:
install.packages("animint2")

# If you want to install the development version:
devtools::install_github("animint/animint2")
```


## Use

Animint2 uses the same implementation of `ggplot2`’s grammar of graphics—with a few additions. If you’re familiar with `ggplot2`, using `animint2` will be easy. If you’re not, no worries. To get started, see the brief [Animint2 Quick Start Guide](https://animint.github.io/animint2/articles/animint2.html) or read the first few chapters of the [Animint2 Manual](https://rcdata.nau.edu/genomic-ml/animint2-manual/Ch00-preface.html).

`animint2` renders and animates data visualizations. It can neither manipulate the datasets you give it nor generate its own data.


## Similar Packages

`animint2` isn’t the only R package that can create animated or interactive data visualizations.

[animation](https://cran.r-project.org/package=animation) and [gganimate](https://cloud.r-project.org/web/packages/gganimate/index.html) can animate changes between variables over time. The [loon](https://cran.r-project.org/package=loon) package specializes in exploratory data analysis. [plotly](https://cran.r-project.org/package=plotly) is probably most similar to animint2 in terms of functionality.

For comparisons between the aforementioned packages and `animint2`, see [the differences wiki page](https://github.com/animint/animint2/wiki/Differences-with-other-packages).


## Problems?

The `animint2` package is a work in progress. If you spot any bugs or unexpected behaviors, please let us know by [reporting it as an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/animint/animint2/issues). Thanks! Have a great day.
