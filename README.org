animint2 provides an animated, interactive grammar of graphics

[[https://travis-ci.org/tdhock/animint2][https://travis-ci.org/tdhock/animint2.png?branch=master]]

** Installation

#+BEGIN_SRC R
devtools::install_github("faizan-khan-iit/ggplot2@validate-params")
devtools::install_github("tdhock/animint2")
#+END_SRC

** Usage

For animint2 usage examples, see our extensive set of [[file:tests/testthat][test cases]].

Another good reference is the [[http://cbio.ensmp.fr/~thocking/animint-book/Ch02-ggplot2.html][Animint Designer Manual]], which uses the
old syntax. We eventually plan to port all of those examples to the
new syntax.

** Differences with old animint

This package is a redesign of [[https://github.com/tdhock/animint][animint]] with a cleaner syntax. In the
old animint we had showSelected/clickSelects as aesthetics, and in
animint2 they are now parameters. Consider the following example [[http://members.cbio.mines-paristech.fr/~thocking/data/PeakSegJoint-H3K4me3-test/1/figure-train-errors/][data
viz]], adapted from
[[file:tests/testthat/test-renderer1-variable-value.R]]. The data set used
to draw the blue line segments in the bottom plot looks like this:

#+BEGIN_SRC R
> with(peak.problems, data.frame(selector.name=paste0(problem.name, "peaks"), problem.name, peaks, bases.per.problem))
             selector.name       problem.name peaks bases.per.problem
1  size.100.problem.1peaks size.100.problem.1     1               100
2  size.100.problem.2peaks size.100.problem.2     1               100
3   size.50.problem.1peaks  size.50.problem.1     1                50
4   size.50.problem.2peaks  size.50.problem.2     1                50
5   size.50.problem.3peaks  size.50.problem.3     1                50
6   size.50.problem.4peaks  size.50.problem.4     1                50
7  size.100.problem.1peaks size.100.problem.1     2               100
8  size.100.problem.2peaks size.100.problem.2     2               100
9   size.50.problem.1peaks  size.50.problem.1     2                50
10  size.50.problem.2peaks  size.50.problem.2     2                50
11  size.50.problem.3peaks  size.50.problem.3     2                50
12  size.50.problem.4peaks  size.50.problem.4     2                50

#+END_SRC

and the old animint code looks like this:

#+BEGIN_SRC R
geom_segment(aes(
  showSelected.variable=selector.name,
  showSelected.value=peaks,
  clickSelects=problem.name,
  showSelected2=bases.per.problem),
  data=peaks.dt)
#+END_SRC

- In both animint and animint2, there are "selectors" which are
  variables in the interactive graphic that can change based on what
  you click on. 
- The =aes(clickSelects)= means that whenever you click on one of these
  segments, the =problem.name= selector will change. For example
  clicking the segment that is plotted for the first row of data will
  change =problem.name= to =size.100.problem.1=.
- The =aes(showSelected2)= means that the only segments that will be
  shown are the ones which correspond to the current value of the
  =bases.per.problem= selector. For example the segment for the first
  row of data will only be shown if =100= is selected for the
  =bases.per.problem= selector.
- The =showSelected.variable= and =showSelected.value= mean to show
  the segment only if the value of =showSelected.value= is the current
  selection of the =showSelected.value= selector. For example the
  segment for the first row of data will only be shown if =1= is
  selected for the =size.100.problem.1peaks= selector.

The new syntax uses parameters instead of =aes=, so is much more concise:

#+BEGIN_SRC R
geom_segment(
 showSelected=c(selector.name="peaks", "bases.per.problem"),
 clickSelects="problem.name")
#+END_SRC

Both =showSelected= and =clickSelects= should be character
vectors. Named elements of the character vector are interpreted as the
old variable/value aes, and un-named elements are interpreted as the
old clickSelects/showSelected aes.
