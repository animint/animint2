## About

This file explains why there are all these TODOs scattered
about some of the `.Rd` files in `man/`. There are 2 kinds
of TODOs:

1. TODO add source
2. TODO add codebook

The 1st appears only in 2 files: `FluView.Rd` and `intreg.Rd`.
It means that the source for the file is missing.

The 2nd appears in all of the files that contain a TODO. 
It means that an explanation for each column's variable is
missing. Since variable names are often either truncated or
not obvious, having a brief explanation of each variable
helps the reader use the dataset.

A good example of a dataset with a good-enough codebook is
`diamonds.Rd`. It gives enough information to make the
dataset useable. Good-enough is probably good enough. I
reckon most people don't Animint2 for its datasets.

Sorry in advance if some of this writing seems condescending.
You probably know all of this already. I write like this cuz
I forget things a lot, and documentation helps future me.
